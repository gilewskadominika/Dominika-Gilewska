### Hello World !
My name is Dominika, I am 27 years old, and a year ago, I decided to completely turn my life around. 
After obtaining a master's degree in Psychology, I chose to become a programmer. I successfully 
completed a Python Developer course, and additionally, in March, I took part in a certified SCRUM 
course. Now i'm an attendant in JavaScript and React course in the evenings.  From the very beginning, I fell 
in love with programming, and it has changed the way I think. Besides traveling and programming, I play 
League of Legends and The Witcher (I am passionate about both books and games).
